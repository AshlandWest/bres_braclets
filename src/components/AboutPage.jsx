          <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Hi! I’m Breonna!</span> I am ten
          years old and love to craft. I was enjoying making friendship
          bracelets, so I thought this would be fun! I also enjoy coding,
          drawing, writing, horseback riding, swimming, skiing and reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have six cats, two dogs and a guinea pig. I have two older brothers
          and one sister who is nine. My eldest brother, Ash, helped me create
          this site, and I am very thankful!
        </p>

          I currently am homeschooled. I am in 5th grade, and love the name we
          decided upon for our school: Mountain Dreamers Schoolhouse.

          I first started making friendship bracelets a couple of years ago, but
          got back into them recently, when reading Fish In A Tree with my
          friend and sister. I hope you enjoy viewing my creations (and my
          brother’s) and get ideas for your own!
