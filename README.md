# A Blog Site for Breonna's Friendship Bracelet Hobbie

## Intentions

My little sister, Breonna, has been getting into making friendship bracelets lately. She told me she is keeping a "blog" of them by taking notes on her IPad.
I want to support her in her creative endeavors, so I decided to build her a real blog she can share with her friends.

## Technologies

### Front End

I am building this app using React to dynamically render components into [HTML5Up's template, Future Imperfect](https://html5up.net/future-imperfect "Origonal HTML5Up Template").

### Back End

I am using a simple Node.js back end, using express to handle routes. Data is stored in an SQL database.

### NPM Scripts

This project was initalized using Create React App. Associated NPM scripts should function as intended.
